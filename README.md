# JavaScript Client API for Web Time Series Service

**WTSS** is a lightweight web service for handling remote sensing imagery as time series. Given a location and a time interval you can retrieve the according time series as a JavaScript array of double values.

If you want to know more about WTSS service, visit the [Earth Observation Web Services homepage](https://github.com/e-sensing/eows) and the [WTSS specification](https://github.com/e-sensing/eows/blob/master/doc/wtss.md).

There are also client APIs for other programming languages: [R](https://github.com/e-sensing/wtss.r) and [Python](https://github.com/e-sensing/wtss.py).
